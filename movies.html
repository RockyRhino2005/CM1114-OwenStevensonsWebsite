                </div>

                <p>I am the Watcher and this Is my confession.</p>

                <p>I am but a watcher, a myth, a legend and I do not intervene, but this time, this time I should have done something.</p>
                    
                <p> I should have stopped Emperor Owen. </p>
                    
                <p>Before becoming Emperor of the Odium Imperium, Owen was a brilliant scientist, dedicated his efforts to the study of cloning with the intention of genetically altering organisms to attain what he perceived as 'perfection'. His ambition and pursuit of scientific advancement drove him to explore controversial and ethically complex territory. </p>
                    
                <p>Throughout his research, Owen delved into the intricacies of genetic manipulation, pushing the boundaries of what was deemed acceptable by the scientific community. He aimed to create organisms that possessed enhanced traits, surpassing the limitations imposed by natural evolution. However, his relentless pursuit of perfection led him down a path with sinister implications. </p>
                    
                <p>As Owen's work progressed, ethical concerns began to emerge within the scientific community. His experiments raised profound questions about the morality and consequences of tampering with the natural order of life. The potential risks and unforeseen outcomes associated with his research worried his peers, leading to a growing sense of unease and opposition. Ultimately he was fired and exiled by the scientific community. </p>
                    
                <p>Outraged, Owen set about to pursue his research individually, hearing of rumours of an ancient dark text. Owen became drawn to the allure of the ancient Darkhold book rumored to be hidden within a temple nestled high in the mountains, Owen began his journey. The Darkhold said to possess immense power and forbidden knowledge, capable of granting its wielder great abilities. </p>
                    
                <div>
                    <img class="storyright" src="Images/darkhold.jpg" alt="Darkhold" width="300" height="300" />
                </div>

                <p>As Owen trekked through the treacherous terrain, he finally reached the temple entrance. The ancient structure looming before him, a testament to the mysteries that lie within. He cautiously stepped inside, guided only by whispers of the Darkhold's location. </p>
                    
                <p>Within the temple's depths, Owen faced various trials and challenges meant to deter those seeking the Darkhold's power. </p>
                    
                <p>After enduring numerous trials, Owen finally discovered the inner sanctum of the temple. There, resting upon a pedestal, lied the Darkhold. The tome emitted an aura of dark energy, its pages filled with arcane symbols and forbidden incantations. </p>
                    
                <p>As Owen reached out to grasp the Darkhold, he felt a surge of power course through his veins. </p>
                    
                <p>Initially Owen wished to use the Darkhold to perfect his research, however the Darkhold gave Owen hunger for more power, He no longer wanted to create 'perfection', he wanted to be superior to all.. </p>
                    
                <p>Using the stolen Darkhold, Owen delved deeper into its pages, seeking hidden knowledge and ancient rituals that could further augment his powers. He conducted experiments on himself, pushing the boundaries of his own physical and mental capabilities. Through the merging of science and magic, Owen transformed himself into a being of immense strength and twisted ambition, Owen became a god-like entity. </p>
                    
                <p>With his gained knowledge and power, Owen returned to the cloning facility seeking revenge on those who had exiled him He tore the facility apart and murdered everyone inside but he still was not satisfied. Owen wanted more. He wanted to rule. </p>
                    
                <p>Owen began studying the Darkhold, refining his knowledge and power waiting for an opportunity to take over the Odium Imperium. The Darkhold had shown him that the Emperor of the Odium Imperium possessed more of this ancient Chaos magic and whenever they die, it passes onto their successor. After Emperor Herbert the 1st passed away during childbirth to his son Herbert the 2nd, Owen knew his time had come so he manipulated his way to the top and claimed his place on the throne of the Odium Imperium. As he sat down and became named as Emperor, rapidly his blood began to boil, his eyes widened and his skin crawled, before all of a sudden his arms felt strong, his skin thickened, his scars healed, power grasped through his veins, he had unlocked his full potential. </p>
                    
                <p>Emperor Owen's reign over the Odium Imperium was marked by his insatiable hunger for power and his relentless pursuit of domination. With the Darkhold and his mastery of Chaos Magic, he transformed himself into a god-like entity, becoming virtually unstoppable but still he needed an apprentice. His cloning expertise allowed him to create Lord Thomas, a loyal and limited copy of himself, who served as his second in command and reliable advisor. </p>
                    
                <p>Together, Emperor Owen and Lord Thomas worked tirelessly to rebuild the Odium Imperium and solidify their control over it. However, their combined power became a threat not only to their own universe but also to the entire multiverse. The Time Variant Authority, an organization tasked with preserving the timeline, attempted to intervene, but they were too late and were swiftly defeated by Emperor Owen's overwhelming might. </p>
                    
                <p>The failure of the Time Variant Authority led to an even greater failure, he became aware... aware of the multiverse. As he travelled between the multiverse, soon he tapped into the field between, finding an even greater weapon, the Infinity Gauntlets. Emperor Owen's acquisition of the Infinity Gauntlets further augmented his power, enabling him to wield unimaginable cosmic forces. </p>
                    
                <div>
                    <img class="storyleft" src="Images/gauntlets.png" alt="Infinity Gauntlets" width="300" height="300" style="float: left;"/>
                </div>
                    
                <p>There was only one entity left to stop him, me... </p>
                    
                <p>Their might soon became more apparent as the battle drew long, I threw all strength into them but it was to no avail. eventually with his intellect and unparalleled power, he wielded the Gauntlets and reduced me to atoms, trapping me in a jar. Now imprisoned in a jar, I am forced to watch them destroy everything, powerless. </p>
                  
                <div>
                    <img class="storyright" src="Images/watcher.webp" alt="Emperor" width="300" height="300" />
                </div>

                <p>Soon after no threats to their power remained, Owen made sure no threats ever emerged again and used his Infinity Gauntlets to destroy the multiverse, leaving only their own universe (M1505) and small fragments of a few others left. </p>
                    
                <p>Emperor Owen was quick to expand the Odium Imperium across the world, crushing any resistance with ruthless efficiency. His ability to predict his opponents moves instilled fear in those who dared to oppose him, further cementing his reign of terror. As a testament to his authority, he even renamed the planet from Planet M to Planet O, asserting his dominance over every aspect of the conquered realm. </p>
                    
                <p>Emperor Owen, now wielding unimaginable power and ruling over the Odium Imperium with Lord Thomas by his side, desired a shift in perception. He wanted to be seen as a beloved and respected leader rather than a feared tyrant. Utilizing his newly acquired abilities, he devised a plan to make everyone in the Odium Imperium forget his past villainous actions. </p>
                    
                <p>Using his mastery of reality-altering magic and the Darkhold's corruptive influence, Emperor Owen initiated a large-scale memory manipulation spell. The spell affected the minds of every individual in the Odium Imperium, erasing their memories of his heinous deeds and replacing them with a revised version of history. </p>
                    
                <p>In this revised history, Emperor Owen became depicted as a benevolent and wise ruler who had saved the Odium Imperium from collapse. His actions were portrayed as necessary for the greater good, and any opposition or rebellions were portrayed as acts of misguided individuals who did not understand his vision for a better future.</p>
                    
                <p>The memory manipulation spell also instilled a deep sense of loyalty and reverence towards Emperor Owen in the minds of the Odium Imperium's inhabitants. They now saw him as an infallible leader, their savior and protector, deserving of their love and respect.</p>
                    
                <div>
                    <img class="storyright" src="Images/crowd.jpg" alt="Unsuspecting Followers" width="300" height="200" />
                </div>

                <p>With the altered memories firmly in place, Emperor Owen and Lord Thomas continued their rule, now hailed as benevolent figures by their subjects. They implemented reforms and policies that seemingly benefited the people, further solidifying their image as beloved leaders.</p>
                    
                <p>However, deep within the jar where I remain imprisoned, my memories remain intact, immune to Emperor Owen's manipulation. I alone hold the truth about his villainous past and the destruction he had wrought upon the multiverse. While I am powerless in my current state, I still harbour a desperate hope that one day I will find a way to challenge Emperor Owen and expose the truth to the people of the Odium Imperium.</p>
                    
                <p>For now, I'm forced to watch as Emperor Owen's reign of apparent benevolence continued, wondering if anyone would ever uncover the dark secrets behind the facade and stand against the tyrant who had rewritten history.</p>
